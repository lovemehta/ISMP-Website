		<h1><center>Frequently asked questions</center></h1><article>
<h2>Hostel Life</h2><br>
<strong>1. How are hostels allotted to freshmen? Does my hostel change every year?</strong><br><br>
<p>Entire first year is allotted a single hostel (separate hostel for girls). Room allotment is completely random. For boys, four students are accommodated in one room in order to allow better interaction within your batch. Hostel changes only after completing two academic years in college wherein two students stay in one room. Special request is to be made for changing hostel room.</p>

<strong>2. I have never lived in a hostel before. What should I expect from IIT hostels?</strong><br><br>
<p>Hostel life is going to be very different from your home. At beginning you may feel the need of larger rooms where lesser number of students live in, but at the end of your stay, you would be crying to stay back. You are going to cherish your hostel memories for the rest of our life.</p>

<strong>3. What facilities are available in the hostel?</strong><br><br>
<p>Facilities including barber shop, laundry service (paid), a well-equipped gymnasium, common room (TV room which is no less than a theatre during cricket and football finals), RO filtered water, open terrace, gallery for better ventilation, restroom with geyser (shared between two rooms), individual cupboards/Godrej almirah for storage, a table and a chair for each student, Wi-Fi zone and lastly four high speed LAN ports (unlimited data download) are available in each room which also enable intra-hostel data sharing.</p>

<strong>4. What about the mess food? Is the food really tasty and healthy? Do we have a say in the menu?</strong><br><br>
<p>There is Mess-1 for Jupiter, Neptune and Venus hostels and Mess-2 for Mercury hostel. Mess fees is included in the hostel fee itself and is to be paid every semester. Apart from this, night canteen is available (until 3 in the morning) and also a regular canteen in daytime.</p>
<p>Quite honestly, saying that mess food is tasty would somewhat be an overstatement when you would be coming here after having eaten home-cooked food for almost 18 years of your life. However, it is hygienic, nutritious, filling and already paid for. A weekly menu is decided at a periodic interval for the hostel. In case for a change, there are many places outside the campus where you can eat. Every resident has a say in deciding the weekly mess menu. There is a complaint register available in the mess in case you find the quality of food degraded. Feedback is always welcomed. For immediate actions you can contact your hostel Mess Secretary.</br>This is an example of mess menu that we have.(Keeps changing a bit seasonally.)</br>

<h2>Academics</h2><br>
<strong>1.How is evaluation and grading done?</strong><br><br>
<p>Evaluation in each semester comprises of a mid semester and an end semester exam, and quizzes, practicals etc. depending on the course and course coordinator.</p></br>
<p>Grading Scheme-</br>Each subject has some credits, and the grade is assigned on the basis of the performance either relative or absolute as decided by the course coordinator. The various grades that can be assigned are: <table><tr><td>A</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td>A-</td><td>9</td></tr>
<tr><td>B</td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr><td>B-</td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>C-</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>D</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>E</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>F</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>I</td><td>Incomplete</td></tr>
</table></p><p>Grades upto D are considered pass, beyond D (ie E, F) are considered fail. However if a student cannot complete the course for some reason, he/she may be awarded an I.</br>The final semester grade point is calculated as the credit weighted average of the grades.</br>
Eg. If  a student has three courses in a semester say sub1,sub2 and sub3. Lets</p><p>
<table><th>Subject</th><th>Credits</th><th>Grade</th><tr><td>sub1</td><td>4</td><td>B</td></tr>
<tr><td>sub2</td><td>3</td><td>B-</td></tr>
<tr><td>sub3</td><td>4</td><td>A-
</td></tr>
</table>
                  </p>
                  <p>The semester grade point will be ( 4*8 + 3*7 + 4*9 )/( 4 + 3 + 4 ) =  8.09</p>

				<p>In the first year, all the students will be given an overview of all the three branches of engineering taught at IIT Ropar ie Computer Science, Electrical and Mechanical, so as to give the students the perspective of different fields of engineering also that would help students who might opt for a change in their branch.</p>
                <strong>3.Are there any scholarships or fee concession programs we can apply for?</strong><br><br><p>The institute offers Merit-cum-Means scholarship to about 25% of the students. The recipients of the scholarship are exempted from paying the tuition fee and get a scholarship of Rs.1000/- per month. The criteria for the same are based on the ALL INDIA RANK (AIR) in the JEE and Means (only those students are eligible, whose parental income is below Rs.4.5 lac per annum). Further as per IIT rules, there is a limit that the total scholarship received from all sources for a student should not exceed Rs.50,000/- per annum.
