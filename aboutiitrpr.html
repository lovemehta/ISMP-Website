                    <h2>About IIT Ropar</h2>
				<p>Indian Institute of Technology Ropar (IIT Ropar) is one of the eight new IITs set up by the Ministry of
Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India, to expand and enhance the quality of technical education in the country. The Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Govt. of
India, vide its Notification dated 9th May, 2008 decided that Indian Institute of Technology Delhi would
mentor the setting up of IIT Ropar. The foundation stone of the Institute was laid on 24th February 2009.
IIT Ropar was registered as Society under Society Registration Act 1860 on 29th July 2008. The Institute is
currently operating from a transit campus, occupied earlier by the Government Polytechnic for Women.
The transit campus was inaugurated on 19th August 2009. On 20th August, 2009, the classes at transit
campus commenced. Professor M.K. Surappa joined as the first Director of the institute in June, 2009, and
Shri A. Palanivel joined as the first Registrar in July, 2009. This institute is committed to providing state-of-the-
art technical education in a variety of fields and also to facilitating transmission of knowledge in
keeping with the latest developments in pedagogy. These two areas of focus will enable students to gain
exposure to recent trends in their chosen domains of study and practical experience through a wide
variety of activities that the institute facilitates in its own campus and arranges for in collaboration with
industry and other institutes. The Government of Punjab has allotted 501 acres of land on the banks of the
river Satluj to IIT Ropar. When completed, the campus will be a self-contained township catering to all the
needs of faculty, staff and students. At the transit campus, arrangements have been made for classes,
laboratories, hostels and faculty accommodation. In due course of time, the institute will shift to the main
campus. At present, the institute offers Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech.) programme in the following
disciplines: Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. This
programme is spread over a period of eight semesters and the institute admits forty students in each
branch. These students are selected through IIT Joint Entrance Examination conducted every year. Some
of the faculty of IIT Delhi also taught few courses during the first two</p>
			
					<h2>Director's Message</h2>
					
                    <p>Dear Students, Congratulations on joining the IIT Ropar family. On behalf of the Institute, I welcome you to IIT Ropar, a place where we celebrate youth and excellence and attempt to transform young persons into adults with a sense of social responsibility, human values and concern for environment. We not only strive to train the students to become excellent scientists, technologists, thinkers and leaders of the society, but also help them mould themselves into better human beings. To start with, a 4-year B.Tech programme is offered in three branches, viz., Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering with a strength of 40 students in each branch. The curriculum, course structure and syllabus for the first year courses are similar to (but may not be identical to) that in IIT Delhi. We hope that you would use this opportunity to realize your full potential and bring out the best in you. We are sure that the excellent academic environment and the opportunity to participate in co-curricular activities will also help you in developing your personality and in your all-round development. I believe that your education in IIT Ropar will be a fulfilling experience. There would be of course times when you might feel lonely and stressed, especially during the initial phase of your stay here. During these times, I will strongly suggest that you should not hesitate in seeking help from your student mentor, faculty advisor or the Institute Counselor. We will make a genuine attempt in assisting you during the times of your trials and tribulations. We have also set up a special Help Desk for IIT Ropar to help you resolve your problems, through the voluntary efforts of some of our faculty and staff members. You can approach this help desk at any time during your stay at the IIT Ropar campus to address any of your concerns regarding either academic matters or life in the campus. In case of special needs, you are also welcome to seek the help of the Dean of Student Affairs or the Dean of Academic and Research. I sincerely hope that your academic pursuit in IIT Ropar will be fruitful and enjoyable in every aspect and the experiences you gain here and the moments you spend here will be cherished by you all your life. Wishing you the very best, (Sarit K. Das)</p>
                    <h2>Vision and Mission</h2>
                    <p>

The institute, apart from establishing a robust teaching environment, is keen to facilitate and support cutting-edge research in variety of areas. This aspect, we believe, will enable the students to acquaint themselves with latest developments in their respective areas of study and peruse their own research interests. This would also result in a constant revision of courses that are being taught.

The institute encourages its faculty members to initiate research work and provides an initiation grant and also the basic facilities for its sustenance. It also encourages faculty members to establish collaborative research ventures with other research labs and industry. In this regard, the institute is keen to establish the Central Research Facility. The institute has already started its PhD Programme, so that the research environment is further augmented, expanded, and made even more vibrant.
