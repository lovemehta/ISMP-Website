					<h2>Mentoring Code of Conduct</h2>
					<h3>Aim</h3>
                    <p>The code of conduct is designed to establish a set of guidelines to create a benchmark for ethics and good practice and ensure that mentors conduct their practice in a professional yet, friendly and ethical manner. The code is also meant to inform mentees, and to promote public confidence in the Institute Student Mentorship Program (ISMP) as a process for personal and professional development.</p>
                    <h3>Institute Student Mentorship Program (ISMP)</h3>
            		<p>Institute Student Mentor Programme, (ISMP)</b> is a student initiative, run by IIT Ropar, to make sure that the transition of freshmen into IIT life is smooth and concurrently facitilate the growth of individials so that they can make informed decision when faced with decisions in their life at IIT Ropar. Every freshman joining IIT Ropar is assigned a mentor who will be a friend and guide for the fresher&#39;s stay at IIT Ropar and will help him analyze various options at different stages of IIT life.</p>
                    <h3>Mentors</h3>
                    <p>Mentors are second, third and fourth-year students at IIT Ropar who aid the induction of freshmen and their development process through the academic year. Mentoring is not only about the transfer of knowledge from a more experienced to a less experienced person through learning and dialogue, but also about being a good friend with whom a mentee may share all his hesitations and apprehensions.</p>
					<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
                    <ul><li>Commit to the relationship and the ISMP for one full academic year.</li>
                        <li>Attend and actively participate in all mentoring training and special events, and in the long run suggest and execute any idea relevant to the ISMP.</li><li>Trust and confidentiality are backbone of successful mentoring and must bemaintained at all times. Be careful about sensitive issues. A mentees personal lifemay be difficult to discuss early in the relationship.</li><li>
Should abide to all rules set up by the Proctorial Committee during the initialinteraction period. All meetings with freshers should happen in open and visibleregions and not in closed rooms.</li><li>No illegal drugs should be promoted or consumed within the mentorship activities / meetings.</li>
<li>No alcohol/ tobacco should be promoted or consumed within the mentorship activities / meetings.</li>
<li>Never physically discipline or use abusive language or ultimatums as a tool for putting your point across. Any instance of ragging during mentorship activities is strictly forbidden and will be reported to concerned authorities.</li>
<li>Failure to comply or an outright violation of any of the above may lead to termination from the ISMP for all purposes.</li></ul>	
<h3>Good Practices</h3><ul>
<li>Recognize that mentoring in IIT ROPAR is focused on building a lasting relationship and sharing information.</li>
<li>
During the initial stages of the programme, your mentee may appear hesitant and unresponsive to your help. The mentee&#39;s attitude will take a positive turnover time and after sincere efforts from your end. Be patient!
</li>
<li>Remember there is an initial phase to every relationship. In the early stages, a freshman is interested in knowing how sincere and 'real&#39; you are. Establish a means of communication at the earliest.
</li>
<li>Conduct regular mentor meetings during the initial phase. Inform him of all the activities that take place in IIT especially those recommended for freshmen.
</li>
<li>Consider conducting the mentor meetings in the Common Room/ Mess Hall and not in private, at least during the first month or so (for freshmen). Understand that there is a civilized timing for this meeting, and it should not extend to late night.
</li>
<li>Advise your mentee of complaint procedures in case of an undue approach or an instance of ragging. Remember: His insecurities are heightened by the fact of him being in a new environment.
</li>
<li>Don&#39;t try to be a teacher, parent, therapist or babysitter. Present the information carefully and without any distortion and give all possibilities and solution a fair hearing, without passing a judgement. Suggest ways to solve the problem together, rather than lecture the mentee. Remember: Your role is to respond to the mentee&#39;s needs, not impose your agenda.
</li>
<li>Respect the integrity of your mentee and influence him through constructive feedback. If you have a concern which you believe is beyond your ability to handle, call the MRC Coordinators even if it is trivial.
</li>
<li>Do not give your mentee the silent treatment. Discuss your and his concerns.
</li>
<li>On a very rare occasion you may need to inform the mentee&#39;s parents of any unacceptable behaviour. Before doing this, get in touch with the MRC Coordinators and a professor.
</li>
<li>Don&#39;t make judgements concerning a family conflict or heightened situation.Leave the parenting to the parent.
</li>
<li>If you are informed that your mentee&#39;s safety or safety of another is jeopardised, report this concern to the MRC Coordinators, Hostel Caretaker and Warden or aprofessor immediately.
</li>
<li>As has been seen, mentors have a great deal of impact however, it is not immediately evident. Look for signs: like increased attendance, higher CGPA, timely showing up for mentor meetings and freely expressing appreciation.
</li>
<li>Mentors and mentees will be asked to complete evaluations provided by the Mentorship Committee (MRC). The evaluations will be recorded on an electronic database. This is to ensure that expected standards are met, and to realise ways in which the programme can be further improved during the year and subsequently, over the years to come.
</li>
<li>If you are unhappy about experiences associated with the ISMP or any of its policies, you are requested to speak to the MRC Coordinators.
